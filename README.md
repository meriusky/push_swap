# push_swap
This project sort numbers in a stack, with a limited set of moves, using the fewest number of moves. The maximum number is 500. To do this I had to implement an algorithm, which had to be as optimized as possible.

The conditions were: 
1. It must be a number.
2. It must not be repeated.
3. It must not exceed the size of an int.
4. There must be at least two numbers to be able to order them.

If one of these conditions is not met, the program will not display anything or will give an error.
